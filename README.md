# The Blood Codex — Module One

This repository contains **Module One** of *The Blood Codex*, a self-guided, interdisciplinary course examining menstruation as a biological, symbolic, psychological, and cultural information system.

Rather than treating menstrual blood as waste, inconvenience, or pathology, this module approaches it as **data, archive, and signal**—a recurring physiological process that has been historically medicalized, ritualized, mythologized, and politically controlled.

## What This Module Covers

Module One introduces the foundational lens of the course, moving across multiple interpretive layers:

- **Science** — menstrual physiology, cycle timing, and bodily signals  
- **Theology & Myth** — blood as covenant, taboo, offering, and threshold  
- **Philosophy** — meaning, embodiment, power, and recurrence  
- **Psychology** — projection, mirroring, and somatic memory  
- **Culture & Politics** — how menstruation has been framed, regulated, and silenced  

The goal is not belief adoption, but **literacy**: learning how to read the body as a system shaped by biology *and* meaning.

## Structure

  Served via `index.html`

- **Worksheet Pack**  
  Served via `worksheet.html`

Both files are intended to be used together.

## Intended Audience

This material is designed for readers who are comfortable holding multiple frameworks at once—scientific, symbolic, historical, and psychological—without collapsing them into a single explanatory model.

It may not be suitable for those seeking:
- medical advice
- fertility optimization protocols
- simplified spiritual narratives

## Status

This repository represents a **published module** of an ongoing body of work.
